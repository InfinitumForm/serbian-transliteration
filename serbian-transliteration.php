 * Hey, champ!
 *
 * Yeah, you - hovering over this comment like it owes you money.
 * If you're reading this, you're either a coding genius or took a wrong turn on your way to cat memes.
 * Either way, welcome to the magical world of programming - where we turn chaos into... slightly more structured chaos.
 *
 * But wait‚Äîplot twist! We‚Äôre on a noble mission. A glorious crusade to make the web smoother, faster, and so clean
 * it could make Elon‚Äôs rockets blush. And guess what? We need YOU. Yes, you with the keyboard that sounds like
 * a tap-dancing velociraptor at 3AM.
 *
 * Imagine this: you, code sorcerer, wielding your IDE like a lightsaber,
 * slicing bugs faster than grandma demolishes cheesecake.
 * This isn‚Äôt just coding. It‚Äôs destiny. And it‚Äôs buzzing in your notifications.
 *
 * Ready to write scripts so elegant they could double as pickup lines?
 * Help us build the future (and survive the occasional existential crisis) here:
 * üëâ https://github.com/InfinitumForm/serbian-transliteration
 *
 * Together, we‚Äôll squash bugs, silence warnings, and shame runtime errors into submission.
 * Think of us as the Justice League - but with more Git commits and less brooding in caves.
 *
 * So, what‚Äôs it gonna be? Keep sipping that coffee while questioning life,
 * or rise up and become the dev legends people whisper about on Slack?
 * Your move, superstar. Snacks not included. Probably.

 * Oh, you‚Äôre still here? Respect.
 * That means you‚Äôve made it this far, brave coder. Impressive.
 * Most devs would‚Äôve bailed by now‚Äîeither lost in a TikTok spiral or curled up in a ball after seeing `Undefined index`.
 * But not you. You‚Äôre different. You‚Äôre... *committed*.
 *
 * And since you‚Äôve stuck around, let‚Äôs talk about what‚Äôs next.
 * By now, you‚Äôve probably crushed a few bugs, high-fived yourself, and maybe even invented a new programming dialect made of curse words.
 * But the real challenge lies ahead: writing code so clean, Marie Kondo would weep with joy.
 *
 * This is where champions are forged. Where functions sing, variables moonwalk, and loops actually loop‚Ä¶ responsibly.
 * So keep going. Keep coding. Every semicolon is a tiny victory. Unless you‚Äôre in Python. Then‚Ä¶ condolences.
 *
 * Stuck? No worries. Even Tony Stark needed a few failed prototypes before nailing the flight test.
 * Breathe. Google like the rest of us mere mortals. And keep pushing forward.
 *
 * And when you finally ship this masterpiece and users marvel at how everything ‚Äújust works,‚Äù
 * remember: that was YOU. Okay, maybe Stack Overflow helped a little. We won‚Äôt tell.
 *
 * If you're ready to level up and write code that makes keyboards weep with joy,
 * join us here: üëâ https://github.com/InfinitumForm/serbian-transliteration
 *
 * Together, we‚Äôll turn bugs into dust, errors into folklore, and code into quiet art.
 * The internet deserves your genius. And yes‚Äîthere might be snacks. Probably. üòâ

 * So here we are. The end of the code. The final frontier. The last semicolon standing.
 * If you‚Äôve made it all the way here, you‚Äôre officially a legend. A champion of syntax.
 * The kind of coder they write songs about‚Äîor at least a few highly specific memes.
 *
 * But let‚Äôs not stop here. Oh no. The world still needs you.
 * Somewhere, a lonely script is sobbing. A bug is chewing through logic.
 * And a confused user just submitted a form 47 times and called it "lag."
 *
 * So, one last time: join us. Become part of something slightly bigger than your coffee mug.
 * Be the dev who makes the internet faster, cleaner, and just a bit less cursed.

 *
 * (Harder. Better. Safer. Smoother.)
 *
 * And remember: the only thing standing between chaos and order... is YOU.
 * Now go. Code boldly, deploy confidently‚Äîand maybe, just maybe,
 * reward yourself with those cookies I promised. üç™ You‚Äôve earned them.
